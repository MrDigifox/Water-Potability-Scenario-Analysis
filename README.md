# Water Potability Scenario Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`WaterFinal.ipynb`) that walks through a scenario analysis on the UCI Water Potability dataset. We retrain an optimized neural‐network classification model and then test it under three realistic scenarios—acid rain (lower pH), mineral contamination (higher hardness), and over‐disinfection (higher chloramines)—to see how those changes affect water‐potability predictions.

## Repository Contents

- **WaterFinal.ipynb**  
  The main notebook with:
  - Data loading & preprocessing  
  - Model retraining  
  - Scenario definitions & simulations  
  - Visualization of results (bar charts, violin/box plots, heatmaps, 3D surface, line comparisons)  
  - Insights & implications write-up  

- **water_potability.csv**  
  The original dataset downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isort3306/Water-Potability-Scenario-Analysis.git
